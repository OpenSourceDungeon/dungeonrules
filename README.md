# OpenSourceDungeon
Welcome to OpenSourceDungeon, an open source framework designed to standardize and improve the management of BDSM clubs and dungeons. Our goal is to create a community-driven resource that enhances the safety, inclusivity, and enjoyment of BDSM spaces worldwide.

About This Project
OpenSourceDungeon seeks to address the varied management practices across BDSM clubs by providing a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices that can be adopted and adapted by any club. From health and sanitation to consent management and legal compliance, this framework covers all aspects necessary to run a safe and successful dungeon.

This project is hosted on GitHub to facilitate collaboration, allowing club owners, managers, practitioners, and community members to contribute their expertise and real-world experiences. We believe that together, we can create a dynamic and robust resource that serves the entire BDSM community.
